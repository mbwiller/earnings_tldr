WEB SCRAPING & SENTIMENT ANALYSIS VISION
========================================

OVERVIEW:
This document outlines the vision for web scraping and sentiment analysis features that will enhance the earnings call analysis platform.

CORE COMPONENTS:

1. SOCIAL MEDIA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
   - Reddit (r/investing, r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets)

   - StockTwits
   - LinkedIn company posts and discussions
   
   Development Steps:
   - Implement Reddit API integration (PRAW)
   - Twitter API v2 integration
   - Sentiment analysis using VADER or custom models

   - Filter for relevant ticker mentions

2. FINANCIAL FORUM ANALYSIS
   - Seeking Alpha comments and articles
   - Value Investors Club (if accessible)
   - Motley Fool discussions
   - Yahoo Finance message boards
   
   Development Steps:
   - Web scraping with BeautifulSoup/Scrapy
   - Rate limiting and respectful crawling
   - Content filtering for quality
   - Sentiment classification
   - Author credibility scoring

3. NEWS & BLOG SENTIMENT
   - Financial news websites
   - Company press releases
   - Analyst blog posts
   - Industry publications
   
   Development Steps:
   - RSS feed aggregation
   - News API integration
   - Content summarization
   - Sentiment trend analysis

4. REAL-TIME SENTIMENT DASHBOARD
   - Live sentiment tracking
   - Sentiment correlation with price movements
   - Alert system for sentiment shifts
   - Historical sentiment analysis
   
   Development Steps:
   - Real-time data pipeline (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
   - Time-series database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)
   - WebSocket connections for live updates
   - Dashboard with real-time charts

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. DATA QUALITY & RELIABILITY
   - Never treat social media posts as factual information
   - Use sentiment for market mood analysis only
   - Implement confidence scores for all sentiment data
   - Filter out bots and low-quality content

2. ETHICAL SCRAPING
   - Respect robots.txt files
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Follow API terms of service
   - Consider data privacy implications

3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
   - Scalable microservices architecture
   - Caching layer for API responses
   - Database optimization for time-series data
   - Monitoring and alerting systems

4. COMPLIANCE & LEGAL
   - Review terms of service for all platforms
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Consider GDPR and other privacy regulations
   - Legal review of scraping activities

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

1. MACHINE LEARNING INTEGRATION

   - Anomaly detection for unusual sentiment patterns
   - Predictive models for price movements

2. ADVANCED ANALYTICS
   - Sentiment correlation with earnings surprises
   - Social sentiment as leading indicator
