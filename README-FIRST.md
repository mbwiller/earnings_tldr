# EarningsCall-TLDR: Your Complete Guide to Understanding and Building This Platform

## What This Project Actually Does (In Plain English)

Imagine you're an investor who just missed an important earnings call. You know it's crucial for your investment decisions, but you don't have 2 hours to listen to the entire call. What if you could get a **smart summary** that tells you exactly what matters?

That's exactly what this platform does. It's like having a **super-intelligent financial analyst** who:
1. **Reads** the entire earnings call transcript
2. **Understands** what's important for stock prices
3. **Explains** it to you in three different ways:
   - **Quick bullets** (Why the stock moved)
   - **Plain English** (What happened, explained simply)
   - **Expert analysis** (Deep dive for serious investors)

## How It Works

### The Technology Behind It

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** - This is the "brain" of the system. Think of it like having a super-smart assistant who:
- **Remembers** everything they've read
- **Finds** the most relevant information when you ask a question
- **Creates** intelligent responses based on that information

**NLP (Natural Language Processing)** - This is how the computer "understands" human language. It's like teaching a computer to read and comprehend text the way humans do.

## Current State: What's Already Built
